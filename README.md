# fablebound

This repo is for the ESP32 control code for Fable Bounds Pneumatic system. We are calling the control board "Ymir" after the first of the Giants created in Norse Mythology. 

# Setup

The build process relies on https://platformio.org/ using the extensions for VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/. 

# Local Development

The Arduino libraries are mocked for local builds allowing the use of a C++ console application for local debugging. There are configurations included to build the code with the clang compiler.
